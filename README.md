# next-payload-starter

A Turborepo monorepo starter for content-driven web apps. Bundles Next.js 16, PayloadCMS 3, better-auth, MongoDB, Tailwind v4, Vitest, Storybook, and Biome — all wired up with the conventions, import boundaries, and CI scaffolding that make a fresh project usable in minutes instead of weeks.

The `posts` collection and `/posts` routes are a deliberately skeletal example demonstrating the feature-folder layout — adapt or replace per project.

## Getting started

Spin up a new repo from this template:

```sh
gh repo create my-app --template trroev/next-payload-starter --public
cd my-app
pnpm install
docker compose up -d                   # local MongoDB on :27017
pnpm dev                               # app at :3000, admin at /admin
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 24
- pnpm (managed via corepack — `corepack enable`)
- Docker (for local MongoDB)

### Environment

Env loading goes through [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com) (`--convention=nextjs`). The committed `apps/web/.env.development` ships **working dummy defaults** — a local Mongo URI, dev-only secrets — so a fresh clone runs `pnpm dev` with no env setup. Override anything per-machine in the gitignored `apps/web/.env.development.local` (or `.env.local`); those win over the committed defaults.

The dev-only `PAYLOAD_SECRET` / `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` are placeholders — **replace them before deploying anywhere real.** For shared or production secrets, put real values in `apps/web/.env.production` (or `.env.development`) and encrypt them in place:

```sh
cd apps/web
dotenvx encrypt -f .env.production
```

This generates `apps/web/.env.keys` (the private decryption key, gitignored) and rewrites the env file with encrypted ciphertext. Commit the encrypted file; **never commit `.env.keys`** — keep it in your password manager. To add or update a secret later:

```sh
dotenvx set SOME_SECRET "value" -f .env.production
```

Each `@repo/env/<subsystem>` module validates only the keys it owns; see [`packages/env/README.md`](./packages/env/README.md) for the subpath map.

### MongoDB

Local dev uses the Docker container in `docker-compose.yml`. For a hosted database, see [`docs/atlas-setup.md`](./docs/atlas-setup.md) for the full Atlas provisioning runbook (cluster, network access, per-database users).

Per-package READMEs:

- Apps — [`web`](./apps/web/README.md), [`storybook`](./apps/storybook/README.md), [`e2e`](./apps/e2e/README.md)
- Packages — [`auth`](./packages/auth/README.md), [`chrome`](./packages/chrome/README.md), [`env`](./packages/env/README.md), [`logger`](./packages/logger/README.md), [`payload`](./packages/payload/README.md), [`storybook-config`](./packages/storybook-config/README.md), [`tailwind`](./packages/tailwind/README.md), [`testing`](./packages/testing/README.md), [`tsconfig`](./packages/tsconfig/README.md), [`types`](./packages/types/README.md), [`ui`](./packages/ui/README.md), [`utils`](./packages/utils/README.md)
- CI — [`tooling/github`](./tooling/github/README.md)

### Import boundaries

Layered dependencies are enforced by Biome's `noRestrictedImports` rule in `biome.json`:

- `packages/{utils,types,env,logger}` may not import from `packages/{ui,chrome,payload,auth}`
- `packages/ui` may not import from `packages/{chrome,payload}` or any app
- `packages/chrome` may not import from any app
- `apps/web/src/features/**` may not import via the `~/features/*` alias at all (cross-feature imports are banned, and intra-feature imports must use relative paths) and may not import from `~/app/**`

**Adding a new feature requires no `biome.json` edits** — the single `apps/web/src/features/**` override applies to every feature.

`pnpm boundaries` (Turborepo's `turbo boundaries`, run in the CI lint job) complements Biome by catching imports of packages **not declared** in a `package.json`. See [`tooling/github/README.md`](./tooling/github/README.md) for the full CI layout.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start all apps in watch mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build all apps and packages |
| `pnpm lint` | Check linting and formatting (Biome via ultracite) |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint and formatting issues |
| `pnpm format` | Check formatting only |
| `pnpm format:fix` | Auto-fix formatting |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check all packages |
| `pnpm test` | Run test suite |
| `pnpm coverage` | Run tests with coverage |
| `pnpm boundaries` | `turbo boundaries` — undeclared-dep check |
| `pnpm catalog:check` | Fail if a `package.json` pins a catalogued dep |
| `pnpm generate:types` | Regenerate Payload-generated TS types |

---

## Logging

`@repo/logger` is the sanctioned logging primitive; `console.*` is banned by Biome's `noConsole` rule. See [`packages/logger/README.md`](./packages/logger/README.md).

## ISR revalidation

Post pages are statically rendered and revalidated on demand via a Payload `afterChange` hook. See [`packages/payload/README.md`](./packages/payload/README.md#isr-revalidation) for the request shape and retry behavior.

---

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR and on pushes to `main`. The composite actions in `tooling/github/ci/` enforce:

- Clean lockfile (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
- Fresh Payload types (`payload generate:types` + `git diff --exit-code`)
- Lint, type-check, tests, and a successful build
- Codecov upload — patch coverage gate at 80% (configured in `codecov.yml`)

`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` is set for the steps that touch the Payload config so they don't require real credentials. See [`tooling/github/README.md`](./tooling/github/README.md) for per-action detail.

### Remote caching (optional)

CI and local builds can share a Turborepo cache via [Vercel Remote Cache](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching). It's **off by default** — the template ships without a Vercel project, so `ci.yml` reads `TURBO_TOKEN` / `TURBO_TEAM` that don't exist yet and turbo simply logs `Remote caching disabled` and falls back to local caching. CI still passes.

To enable it in your fork:

1. Get your Vercel **team slug** (Vercel → Settings → General) — this is `TURBO_TEAM`. A team is enough; you don't need a deployed project.
2. Create a token: `npx turbo login && npx turbo link`, or Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens.
3. In GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:
   - Secret `TURBO_TOKEN` = the token
   - Variable `TURBO_TEAM` = the team slug
4. Push, let CI run once to seed the cache, then push again — the lint/type-check/test/coverage jobs should show remote cache hits.

---

## Deployment

The app deploys as a single Vercel project. Payload's embedded architecture means no separate server process.

```sh
turbo run build --filter=web
```

See `apps/web/vercel.json` for the build command Vercel uses. That file also sets `ignoreCommand` to `npx turbo-ignore web`, so Vercel skips the build whenever a push doesn't touch `web` or anything in its dependency graph — no dashboard configuration required. `turbo-ignore` is pinned as a root devDependency for deterministic builds.
